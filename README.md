# MPU6050-Sensor-Project
Prototyping a Measuring Device to Measure Tilt Angle Using Gyroscope and Accelerometer Sensor

This is my second-year mechanical engineering project for subject EMC311-Measurement & Instrumentation, which we were assigned into groups to create a working measuring device using various types of sensor. For this project, my team and I was proposing a tilt angle measuring device using MPU6050 powered by Arduino. Our main prospect is for marine and aviation use. The gyroscope and accelerometer that built in the ship can be used to determine the tilting angle of the ship when the wave hit it. The angle of tilting will be displayed at monitor giving the idea to the captain and crew on how bad the situations are going on. When the situation is predicted to be out of control, IoT implimentation will be helpful where the rescue teams will alert earlier making the rescue process executed swiftly.

The main library for MPU6050 and I2CDev was taken from https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050.
